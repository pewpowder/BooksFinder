// Todo
*. Changing the address bar (
	It is considered a good tone when we can link to a public page and the other person will see everything exactly as we do: content sorting, amount, start and end. The address bar and page URLs are used for this purpose.
)
*. Learn how fetch works.
*. Implement tests
*. Check how to correct validate errors in JS.
*. Remove pages, routing and store folders

 * @param params
 * @returns
 */) /** + tab
*. May be I can send request several times, when user has loaded more then 40 books using Promise.all or smth.
*. Revise ??, &&, ||.
*. Revise async/await.
